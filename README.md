I have to give thanks to some mentors and different people I have and had
- Mike Sperber: He is the one who brought me to the paradigm of functional programing
- Eric Knauel: He supported me in many things like cryptology and others
- Hans RÃ¶hr: He was my teacher in systems and assembler he was a good teacher and a 
  good man... we very much regret that he died in the year 2020.
- Hr. Toll: He coached me during my practical year



I also have to give thanks to my parents and my sister and my wife and my kids who made it possible to get there I am
and gave me the power and the time (they had to do without me) to develop and study.
